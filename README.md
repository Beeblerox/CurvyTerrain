**CurvyTerrain**
============

Experimenting with drawtriangles API to generate procedural curvy terrain. Used with flixel

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Issues
-------------
These are the issues I'm coming across for specific platforms.

> **CPP**

> - BitmapFill does not allow for repeat for OpenFL Legacy. Because of this, each uvt point that is drawn cannot go over 1%.
> - If OpenFL Next is used, memory use goes thru the roof. I've included a .hxt file to be loaded into hxScout.
> - I've noticed a weird difference in starting position. It is supposed to start at 50% height, but seems to start at 0.
